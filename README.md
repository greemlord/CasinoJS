# CasinoJS
----------

> **This is a tutorial repository**.  
> Every branch represent a step toward the solution.

CasinoJS is a Javascript based casino game with which to practice whith a rudimental code architecture.

The objectives of this code are:

- implementig a casino game with a wallet and an active user interaction
- handling a dynamic list of games, new games must be easy pluggable into the casino
- keep code complexity to the bare bone
- test portions of the project in isolation

All the UI and user interactions are solved using:

- `console.log`
- `alert()`
- `prompt()`

All the focus is on the application and games logic.

## How Do I Follow This Tutorial?

This is the `master branch` of the repository, there are just two files here:

- `README.md`
- `index.html`

`index.html` is the application's entry point and you should start by run this file and read at it's code source.

> Run this tutorial on `Google Chrome` browser and keep the `developer tools console` always open in order to visualize all the outputs.

When you think you understand what is exposed in the `index.html` you can **switch branch to move** on in the tutorial.

Branches names are prefixed by a progressive numbet `001, 002, ...` so you seriously can't mistake this!

Each branch introduces someting new and the **new concepts are highlighted by comments**, of course comments of previous branches are removed so you can focus on the newly introduced concepts.

> You must follow the tutorials progression to keep a good grasp on the evolution of this project.
